## 🧩 Intel X520 10G Adapter Activation Summary

This guide documents how to activate Intel X520 10G network adapters that fail to load due to unsupported SFP modules.  
It includes identification, root cause, solution, and post-fix verification steps.

---

### 1. 🔍 Identification

Detected hardware via **PCIe**:
```bash
03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet 10G 2P X520 Adapter (rev 01)
03:00.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet 10G 2P X520 Adapter (rev 01)
```

**Problem:**  
The `ixgbe` driver fails to load because of a third-party SFP module:
```bash
ixgbe 0000:03:00.0: failed to load because an unsupported SFP+ or QSFP module type was detected.
ixgbe 0000:03:00.1: failed to load because an unsupported SFP+ or QSFP module type was detected.
```

---

### 2. ⚠️ Root Cause

Intel X520 adapters strictly validate SFP modules.  
If a **non-Intel or third-party** transceiver/DAC is installed, the driver blocks initialization, resulting in error `-95` and missing interfaces (`enp3s0f0`, `enp3s0f1`).

---

### 3. 🛠️ Solution — Allow Unsupported SFP

Force the driver to accept non-Intel transceivers by enabling the `allow_unsupported_sfp` option.

Run the following commands:
```bash
echo "options ixgbe allow_unsupported_sfp=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/ixgbe.conf
update-initramfs -u
reboot
```

---

### 4. ✅ Verification After Reboot

Check driver load status:
```bash
dmesg | grep ixgbe
```
**Expected:**
```
ixgbe 0000:03:00.0: Intel(R) 10 Gigabit Network Connection
ixgbe 0000:03:00.0: NIC Link is Down
```

Confirm that interfaces are now visible:
```bash
ip link show | grep enp3s
```
**Expected:**
```
enp3s0f0
enp3s0f1
```

Check link and speed:
```bash
ethtool enp3s0f0
```

### 5. 🧾 Notes

- The `allow_unsupported_sfp=1` parameter is **safe** and widely used by system administrators.
- Tested and verified with **Firmware 4.30 (0x80002192) / NVM 1.2688.0**.
- After applying this fix:
  - Interfaces appear normally in **Proxmox VE Web GUI**.
  - You can assign them to bridges (e.g. `vmbr0`, `vmbr1`) for VM or Ceph traffic.
